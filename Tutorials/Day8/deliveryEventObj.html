        Low-level languages, like C, have low-level memory management primitives like malloc() and free(). On the other
        hand, JavaScript values are allocated when things (objects, strings, etc.) are created and "automatically"
        freed when they are not used anymore. The latter process is called garbage collection. This "automatically" is
        a source of confusion and gives JavaScript (and other high-level languages) developers the impression they can
        decide not to care about memory management. This is a mistake.
